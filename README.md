# Sabers-Simulator-Game
This is a small side project that I have been scripting over the past 1.5 years along with some AWESOME people from all over the world. Shoutout to:

Xen From Australia and Sinful From Canada: You're SICK scripters, it's been an honor scripting with you :)
Bio: You're the kindest map builder I have ever met. Your details are so accurate and your work is amazing. 
DynMo: Thanks for helping us stay on track.

Though this is a relatively small project (compared to others out there), there has been many ups and downs. Nonetheless, we pushed through it and succeeded.

Next update: Pets and Eggs!
